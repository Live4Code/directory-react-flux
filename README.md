##Flux Employee Directory Example

Rewrite the employee directory app with react and flux architecture.

Running

You must have npm installed on your computer. From the root project directory run these commands from the command line:

npm install

This will install all dependencies.

To build the project, first run this command:

npm start

This will perform an initial build and start a watcher process that will update build.js with any changes you wish to make. This watcher is based on Browserify and Watchify, and it transforms React's JSX syntax into standard JavaScript with Reactify.

After starting the watcher, you can open index.html in your browser to open the app.
